    "Correlation is the relationship between one feature (column) to another. Features can be positively correlated, meaning that they both move in the same direction (if one increases, so does the other and if one decreases, so does the other) or negatively correlated, meaning that they move in opposite directions (if one increases, the other decreases). Correlation values are on a scale from -1 to 1. Features that are positively correlated are closer to 1 and features that are negatively correlated are closer to -1. All features are perfectly positively correlated (exact value of 1) with itself."
